Examples how to use gupnp in python (with gobject-introspection).


$ python demo-events.py
Example with subscribing to LastChange event.

$ python demo.py
It displays UPnP devices, services and actions.
Then it calls: GetVolume, SetAVTransport, Stop and Play actions (when available).

$ python test/demo.py
It starts pdb when first UPnP device is found.


To get demo.py working Gupnp 0.18.4 requires two patches:
* https://github.com/andyhelp/pkg-gupnp/blob/master/debian/patches/0001-python_fix_functions_with_gerror_param.patch
* https://github.com/andyhelp/pkg-gupnp/blob/master/debian/patches/0002-workaround_crash_due_to_not_valid_out_hash_param.patch


What doesn't work:
Action calls doesn't return data back to python. It is down to segmentation fault that was worakaround in second patch.
