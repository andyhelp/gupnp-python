Examples how to use gupnp in python.
GUPnP bindings to python are provided trough gobject-introspection.


To get demo working Gupnp 0.18.3 requires two patches:
* https://github.com/andyhelp/pkg-gupnp/blob/master/debian/patches/0001-python_fix_functions_with_gerror_param.patch
* https://github.com/andyhelp/pkg-gupnp/blob/master/debian/patches/0002-workaround_crash_due_to_not_valid_out_hash_param.patch


$ python demo.py
It displays UPnP devices, services and actions.
When GetVolume action is found it is called.
When SetAVTransport action is found it is called, then Stop and Play.

$ python test/demo.py
It starts pdb when first UPnP device is found.

What doesn't work:
Action calls doesn't return data back to python. It is down to segmentation fault that was worakaround in second patch.
